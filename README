TinyFS is a very simple file system. It is purposefully under-specified, giving you the freedom to
implement it using many of the algorithms and primitives youâ€™ve learned throughout this course.
TinyFS does not support a hierarchical namespace, i.e. there are no directories beyond the root
directory, and all the files are in a flat namespace.
